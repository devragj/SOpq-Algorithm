First step, move the inner unboxed number cycle to be boxed
if (!targetDomino1.isBoxed()) {
                        tab1.moveOpenCycle({x: targetDomino1.x, y: targetDomino1.y + 1});
                } else {
                        tab2.moveOpenCycleToSquare({x: targetDomino1.y + 1, y: targetDomino1.x});
                }

next call openUpPaired()

Now we're in openUpPaired()

We call getCornerData()
In getCornerData(), we move right in the row and up the column.
If there is a blank domino in the row, we record the sign on the dual side.
If there is a signed domino in the column, we record it.
(Note, these two are both column signs, thus constant.)
We find the next top domino (after going along a row and up a column).

Once out of getCornerData(), we can start unmaking boxes.
We do that along the row, at the corner, and up the column.
Once we've unmade the boxes, we need to put signs in on one side or the other.
(TODO check the procedure for this.)

The newTopDomino used to be vertical, at the top of the column.
Now that the boxes are unmade, it is horizontal.
(Unless we've reached the end, it will not stay the in the upper cycle.
Next stage, it goes to the lower cycle.)
