                                The page can be used in two ways.&nbsp;
                                First, you can have the page generate a random input parameter.&nbsp;
                                To do that, enter the size of the parameter in the first textbox.&nbsp;
                                Optionally, enter the number of pairs in the parameter in the second textbox.&nbsp;
                                The number of pairs should be less than or equal to half the number chosen for n.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                After entering this information, click one of the two buttons directly to the right.&nbsp;
                                The Run button will display a randomly-generated parameter and the output of the SO(p,q) Even Algorithm when applied to that parameter.&nbsp;
                                Alternatively, the Run Steps button will also generate a random parameter, and will show you the intermediate steps of applying the SO(p,q) Even Algorithm to that parameter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Pressing Enter while in one of the textboxes will click the Run button to the right.&nbsp;
                                Pressing a button a second time, or a different button, will clear the previous result as it gives you a new result, as will pressing Enter while in a textbox.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                You can also enter an input parameter in the textbox labelled "parameter".&nbsp;
                                A parameter is an arrangement of the numbers 1 through n (with 2 * n = p + q), where each number is either a singleton or paired with another number.&nbsp;
                                Any singleton number has a sign associated to it.&nbsp;
                                There are two sets of signs to choose from, so for convenience, signs in the first set are written as + or -, and signs in the second set are written as s or t.&nbsp;
                                In addition, each pair of numbers has a sign (or orientation) associated with it.&nbsp;
                                So, for example, this is a parameter:&nbsp; 1s 4+ 5- 3_-6 8t 2_9 7_10 11+.&nbsp;
                                The _ is used to indicate a pair of numbers.&nbsp;
                                If a pair has the negative orientation, then the second number in the pair is written with a - sign.&nbsp;
                                Specifically, this will be a parameter for SO(p,q) where p = 2 * (number of + signs) + 2 * (number of pairs) + (number of s signs) + (number of t signs), and similarly q = p = 2 * (number of - signs) + 2 * (number of
                                pairs) + (number of s signs) + (number of t signs).&nbsp;
                                So, the example above is a parameter for SO(12, 10).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                To enter a parameter in the parameter textbox, write the parameter as in the example, with spaces separating the pieces of the parameter.&nbsp;
                                Then, use the Run or Run Steps buttons to the right of that box, as above.

                                This page displays a candidate for the algorithm for computing annihilators and associated varieties for irreducible Harish-Chandra modules for SO(p,q), with p + q even.&nbsp;
                                The input to the SO(p,q) Even algorithm is a parameter for the irreducible Harish-Chandra module.&nbsp;
                                For the purposes of this algorithm, if 2 * n = p + q, then a parameter takes the form of an arrangement of the numbers 1, ..., n, where each number is either a singleton or paired with another number.&nbsp;
                                Any singleton number has a sign associated to it.&nbsp;
                                There are two sets of signs to choose from, so for convenience, signs in the first set are written as + or -, and signs in the second set are written as s or t.&nbsp;
                                In addition, each pair of numbers has a sign (or orientation) associated with it.&nbsp;
                                So, for example, this is a parameter:&nbsp; 1s 4+ 5- 3_-6 8t 2_9 7_10 11+.&nbsp;
                                The _ is used to indicate a pair of numbers.&nbsp;
                                If a pair has the negative orientation, then the second number in the pair is written with a - sign.&nbsp;
                                Specifically, this will be a parameter for SO(p,q) where p = 2 * (number of + signs) + 2 * (number of pairs) + (number of s signs) + (number of t signs), and similarly q = p = 2 * (number of - signs) + 2 * (number of
                                pairs) + (number of s signs) + (number of t signs).&nbsp;
                                So, the example above is a parameter for SO(12, 10).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                A parameter is determined by its pieces (that is, the number/sign combinations and number/number pairs).&nbsp;
                                Unlike in a permutation, the order of the pieces doesn't matter.&nbsp;
                                We will list the pieces in increasing numerical order, where this increasing order disregards the first number of any number pair, and just uses the second number to find its place.&nbsp;
                                (The example parameter above is in this order.)&nbsp;
                                The pieces of the parameter are used by the algorithm in this order.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                This algorithm is very connected to the duality which is defined in Vogan's paper, "Irreducible characters of semisimple Lie groups IV. Character-multiplicity duality".&nbsp;
                                The form of the parameter which we are using is probably not the one which you would choose if you were just looking at one representation.&nbsp;
                                Instead, if you take one of these parameters, interchange + and s, interchange - and t, and change the orientation of every pair, you will obtain the parameter for a representation which is dual to the original
                                representation int the sense of the above-mentioned paper.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                The output of the SO(p,q) Even algorithm is two pairs of tableaux.&nbsp;
                                The left tableau of each pair is a domino tableau with numbers, just as in the output to the Domino Robinson-Schensted algorithm.&nbsp;
                                The right tableau of each pair is a sign tableau, which is used by the algorithm, and also can be used to derive the associated variety of an irreducible Harish-Chandra module.&nbsp;
                                More precisely, the output of the algorithm is an equivalence class of such pairs of pairs of tableaux, with a complicated description of which such quadruples of tableaux can occur, and also a complicated description
                                of the equivalence relationship.&nbsp;
                                With this equivalence relationship, the algorithm is conjecturally a bijection.&nbsp;
                                The left tableau of the first pair corresponds to the primitive idea which is the annihilator of the irreducible Harish-Chandra module associated to the parameter.&nbsp;
                                The right tableau of the first pair describes the associated variety of this Harish-Chandra module.&nbsp;
                                The left and right tableaux of the second pair correspond in the same way to the annihilator and associated variaty of a dual representation of the original Harish-Chandra module.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Each of the four tableaux is presented on a grid of 2 x 2 squares.&nbsp;
                                This grid is an important feature of the algorithm.&nbsp;
                                It shows when a tableau shape is special, as well as how to go from special to non-special configurations of the number tableau, when required by the algorithm.&nbsp;
                                SO(p,q), with p + q even, is of type D, and so for this algorithm, both tableaux are in the D position with respect to the grid.&nbsp;
                                In the D position, the top-left corner of the tableau is in the top-right corner of a 2 x 2 square of the grid.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Within a pair, the two tableaux (number tableau and sign tableau) have the same shape.&nbsp;
                                The two number tableau are roughly (but not quite) transposes of each other.&nbsp;
                                More precisely, you can obtain one from the other by taking a transpose and then moving through some of the open cycles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                You can find out more about the basic ingredients of this algorithm, namely the Domino Robinson-Schensted algorithm and the procedure of moving through cycles, on my website <a href="https://devragj.github.io/" target="_blank">https://devragj.github.io/</a>.
